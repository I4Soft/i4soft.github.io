    abstract={The In Vitro Fertilization Module (IVFm) is a promising method applicable to mono-objective and multiobjective problems, especially for complex and multimodal ones. Its mono-objective implementation coupled to Genetic Algorithm (IVF/GA) and its multiobjective implementation coupled to NSGA-II (IVF/NSGAII) presented promising results due to the balance between exploration and exploitation. Thus, we speculate that IVF can also contribute to Multiobjective Differential Evolution (MODE) like GDE3. So, this paper proposes the IVF/GDE3 - IVF coupled to GDE3. We evaluated IVF/GDE3 against a set of test problems and compared with canonical GDE3 results. The results show that IVF/GDE3 outperformed GDE3 in most of the benchmarks. The IVFm contributed to a faster convergence for the host algorithm (GDE3) and also improved its efficacy.}

    abstract={Genetic improvement for program repair can fix bugs or otherwise improve software via patch evolution. Consider GenProg, a prototypical technique of this type. GenProg\'s crossover and mutation operators manipulate individuals represented as patches. A patch is composed of high-granularity edits that indivisibly comprise an edit operation, a faulty location, and a fix statement used in replacement or insertions. We observe that recombination and mutation of such high-level units limits the technique\'s ability to effectively traverse and recombine the repair search spaces. We propose a reformulation of program repair representation, crossover, and mutation operators such that they explicitly traverse the three subspaces that underlie the search problem: the Operator, Fault and Fix Spaces. We provide experimental evidence validating our insight, showing that the operators provide considerable improvement over the baseline repair algorithm in terms of search success rate and efficiency. We also conduct a genotypic distance analysis over the various types of search, providing insight as to the influence of the operators on the program repair search problem.}

From a heuristic perspective, this approach uses Genetic Algorithms to optimize tuples selection from an original database. In other words, generating a smaller amount of tuples able to detect faults in the instructions. Mutants are analyzed to evaluate each set of data tests selected during the evolutionary process. Once the appropriate reduced database was found, it can be used whenever the SQL statement test is necessary.

    abstract={Recommender systems (RS) are often used as guides, helping users to discover products of their interest. Many techniques and approaches to generate an effective recommendation are available for the system designers. On the one hand, this is interesting because different application’s scenarios could have a fittest solution but on the other it can also cause some complexity to select the best technique to address at each state of the database. Thus, choose the best technique for each new state becomes too difficult and frequent for manually select. One of big challenges on RS is turn the techniques more useful for real-world scenarios. Therefore, automate or help the design decision is an important task to improve the usability of RS and reduce its cost. Although many works aims to improve the performance of RS for some scenarios, just a few of them try to help the designers on selection or combination of the techniques through applications’ state changes. Therefore, this work proposes an evolutionary approach, called Invenire, to automate the choice of techniques used by combining results of different recommendation techniques. This is a new approach that uses a search algorithm to optimize the techniques combination, and can inspire hybrid methods and expert systems on how automate them. To evaluate the proposal, experiments were performed with a dataset from MovieLens and different collaborative filtering approaches. The results obtained show that the Invenire outperforms all collaborative filtering approach separately in all contexts addressed. The improvement achieved varies from 3.6% to 118.99% depending on the combination encountered and the experiment executed. Thus, the proposal was able to increase the accuracy on the generated recommendations and automate the combinations of techniques}

Search-Based Program Repair methods have difficulties to traverse the search space, mainly, because it is challenging and costly to evaluate each variant. Therefore, aiming to improve each program\'s variant evaluation through providing more information to the fitness function, we propose the combination of two techniques, Doc2vec and LSTM, to capture high-level differences among variants and to capture the dependence between source code statements in the fault localization region. The experiments performed with the IntroClass benchmark show that our approach captures differences between variants according to the level of changes they received, and the resulting information is useful to balance the search between the exploration and exploitation steps. Besides, the proposal might be promising to filter program variants that are adequate to the suspicious portion of the code.}

Follow the pattern of programming presents in a project may be useful to understand and maintain the system. Usually, the companies build their own guidelines for coding bug fixes or new features. However, developing this set of rules is not a simple task, and there are even inconsistencies in the specialized literature. Therefore, this paper proposes a new approach to programming style analysis, using a recurrent neural network that learns the programming style presents in a project and determines whether a piece of code submitted to it, follows the project\'s pattern. Such an approach will be used in a distributed development repository based on Pull request, aiding in the automatic approval of increments to the project.}

    abstract={Debugging is frequently a manual and costly task. Some work recently presented automated program repair methods aiming to reduce debugging time. Despite different approaches, the process of evaluating source code patches (potential fixes) is crucial for most of them, e.g., generate-and-validate systems. The evaluation is a complex task given that patches with different syntaxes might share the same semantics, behaving equally for typically limited specifications. Hence, many approaches fail to better explore the search space of patches, leading them to not reach the patch that fixes the bug. Some research points that a buggy code is more entropic, i.e., less natural than its fixed version. So, this work proposes applying Word2vec, a word embedding model, to improve the repair evaluation process based on the naturalness obtained from a corpus of known fixes. Word2vec captures co-occurrence relationships between words in a given context and then predicts the contextual words of a given word. This technique has been applied to deal with richer semantic relationships in a text. Word2vec evaluates patches according to distances of document vectors and a softmax output layer. We analyze the performance of our proposal with mutated patches created from correct source codes and we simulate potential fixes generated by automated program repair approaches. Thus, the main contribution of this paper is a new method to evaluate patches used in automated program repair methods. The results show that Word2vec-based metrics are capable of analyzing source code naturalness and be used to evaluate source code patches.}

Bugs have global impact in terms of cost and time, and they also reflect negatively on a company\'s brand. GenProg is a method for Automated Program Repair based on an evolutionary approach. It aims to generate bug repairs without human intervention or a need for special instrumentation or source code annotations. Its canonical fitness function evaluates each variant as the weighted sum of the test cases that a modified program passes. However, it evaluates distinct individuals with the same fitness score (plateaus). We propose a fitness function that minimizes these plateaus using dynamic analysis to increase the granularity of the fitness information that can be gleaned from test case execution, increasing the diversity of the population, the number of repairs found (expressiveness), and the efficiency of the search. We evaluate the proposed fitness functions on two standard benchmarks for Automated Program Repair: IntroClass and ManyBugs. We find that our proposed fitness function minimizes plateaus, increases expressiveness, and the efficiency of the search.}

    abstract={Fault localisation is an expensive and time-consuming stage of software maintenance. Research is continuing to develop new techniques to automate the process of reducing the effort needed for fault localisation without losing quality. For instance, spectrum-based techniques use execution information from testing to formulate measures for ranking a list of suspicious code locations at which the program may be defective: the suspiciousness formulae mainly combine variables related to code coverage and test results (pass or fail). Moreover previous research has evaluated mutation analysis data (mutation spectra) instead of coverage traces, to yield promising results. This paper reports on a Genetic Programming (GP) solution for the fault localisation problem together with a set of experiments to evaluate the GP solution with respect to baselines and benchmarks. The innovative aspects are the joint investigation of: (i) specialisation of suspiciousness formulae for certain contexts; (ii) the application of mutation spectra to GP-evolved formulae, i.e. signals other than program coverage; (iii) a comparison of the effectiveness of coverage spectra and mutation spectra in the context of evolutionary approaches; and (iv) an analysis of the mutation spectra quality. The results show the competitiveness of GP-evolved mutation spectra heuristics over coverage traces as well as over a number of baselines, and suggest that the quality of mutation-related variables increases the effectiveness of fault localisation heuristics.}

    abstract={GenProg is a stochastic method based on genetic programming that presents promising results in automatic software repair via patch evolution. GenProg\'s crossover operates on a patch representation composed of high-granularity edits that indivisibly comprise an edit operation, a faulty location, and a fix statement used in replacement or insertions. Recombination of such high-level minimal units limits the technique\'s ability to effectively traverse and recombine the repair search spaces. In this work, we propose a reformulation of program repair operators such that they explicitly traverse three subspaces that underlie the search problem: Operator, Fault Space and Fix Space. We leverage this reformulation in the form of new crossover operators that faithfully respect this subspace division, improving search performance. Our experiments on 43 programs validate our insight, and show that the Unif1Space without memorization performed best, improving the fix rate by 34 {\%}.}

    abstract={The creation of a suite of unit testing is preceded by the selection of which components (code units) should be tested. This selection is a significant challenge, usually made based on the team member\'s experience or guided by defect prediction or fault localization models. We modeled the selection of components for unit testing with limited resources as a multi-objective problem, addressing two different objectives: maximizing benefits and minimizing testing cost. To measure the benefit of a component, we made use of metrics from static analysis (cost of future maintenance), dynamic analysis (risk of fault, and frequency of calls), and business value. We tackled gaps and challenges in the literature to formulate an effective method, the Selector of Software Components for Unit Testing (SCOUT). SCOUT provides an automated extraction of all necessary data followed by a multi-objective optimization process. SCOUT is a method able to assist testers in different domains, and the Android platform was chosen to perform our experiments, taking nine leading open-source applications as our subjects. SCOUT was compared with two of the most frequently used strategies in terms of efficacy. We also compared the effectiveness and efficiency of seven algorithms in solving a multi-objective component selection problem. Our experiments were performed under different scenarios, and reveal the potential of SCOUT in reducing the market vulnerability, compared to others approaches. To the best of our knowledge, SCOUT is the first method to assist in an automated way software testing managers in selecting components for the development of unit testing, combining static and dynamic metrics and business value.}

    abstract={The software testing is an important component of software development life cycle, that directly affects quality of software products. Some problems in software testing phase can\'t be optimized only with traditional Software Engineering techniques. It is possible to do the mathematical modelling of those problems in an attempt to optimize them through the search techniques. This study presents a framework for search-based software testing (SBST). The proposed framework works as a top-level layer over generic optimization frameworks and testing software tools, it\'s target is supporting software testers that are not able to use optimization frameworks during a testing activity due to short deadlines and limited resources or skills, also supporting expert or beginners users from optimization area that need or want to compare their metaheuristics with ones from literature and offered by the proposed framework. The framework was evaluated in a experiment of software testing scenario. This scenario was modeled as test case selection problem in which, experiments were executed with different metaheuristics. The results indicate it\'s capability to support the SBST area. The framework was evaluated and compared with other SBST framework in terms of quality metrics, that indicated it\'s extensibility and flexibility as framework.}

    abstract={In this work we developed an algorithm to form collaborative groups on Massive Online Open Courses (Moocs) using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) method. Group learning principles are used in this work as an attempt to overcome the dichotomy that exists between the collective, which involves the formation of an online learning community on a massive scale, and the individual, with different interests, prior knowledge and expectations. The proposed PSO algorithm accomplishes the task of forming groups based on two criteria, level of knowledge and interest, thus forming groups with different levels and similar interests, providing better students\' interactions and knowledge construction. Results of computational tests showed that the algorithm can meet the criteria for grouping in a satisfactory computation time and it is more efficient than algortithms for group formation commonly approached in the literature. Computational tests have also shown that the algorithm is robust taking into account various data sets and variations of iterations.}

    abstract={Fault localization has been one of the most expensive activity in the whole debugging process. The spectrum-based fault localization (SBFL) is the most studied and evaluated technique. Other approach is the mutation-based fault localization technique (MBFL) that needs to execute the test suite on a large amount of mutants increasing its cost. Efforts from research community have been performed in order to achieve solutions reducing such cost and keeping a minimum quality. Current mutation execution strategies are evaluated considering artificial faults. However, recent researches show that some MBFL techniques exhibit low efficacy fault localization when evaluated on real faults. In this paper, we propose a new mutation execution strategy based on failed tests\' mutation score, called (FTScMES), aiming to increase the efficacy on fault localization reducing the cost of mutants execution. FTScMES uses only the set of failed test cases to execute mutants and bases on mutation score concept to compute the suspiciousness statements. The experiments were conducted considering 221 real faults, comparing the efficacy of localization of FTScMES against 5 baselines from the literature. We found that FTScMES outperforms the baselines reducing the cost in 90{\%} on average with a high efficacy of ranking defective code.}

Na escrita, a inserção de um elemento possui relação com os termos que o antecedem.

Todavia, tipicamente, este recurso apresenta tão somente uma lista com opções de palavras cujos caracteres iniciais coincidem com os do termo corrente, ignorando assim um contexto mais amplo.

    abstract={Diversas técnicas de Machine Learning vem sendo aplicadas para resolver o problema da modelagem de áudio. Tais trabalhos permitiram avanços em áreas como a geração de áudio, reconhecimento e classificação de voz. A maioria desses trabalhos manipulam arquivos de áudio em formato raw, que apesar de possibilitar uma maior flexibilidade de manipulação, trás consigo um alto custo computacional. Com base nesse cenário propôs uma abordagem que minimizasse este problema, por meio de uma técnica de reconstrução de áudio de alta qualidade a partir de uma amostra contendo apenas uma fração das informações do sinal original (entre 15 e 50%). Esta tecnica pode ser aplicada em telefonia, compressão e geração de texto, além de sugerir novas arquiteturas para geração de áudio. A rede proposta e conceitualmente simples, pois opera diretamente no arquivo de áudio bruto, escalável, já que utiliza redes convolucionais e feed-foward, alem de já ter sido testada em arquivos de áudio sem fala. O objetivo deste trabalho é aplicar esta técnica em um ambiente diferente do anteriormente exposto, utilizando um dataset na língua portuguesa, com áudios reais, medindo assim medir sua eficácia em outros cenários.},

    abstract={No mundo real há muitos problemas que requerem a otimização simultânea de dois ou mais objetivos conflitantes. Essa classe de problemas é chamada de Problema MultiObjetivo (Multi-objective Problem - MOP). Em MOP\'s, o ganho em um objetivo frequentemente implica em perda em algum outro objetivo. Essa situação e conhecida como "trade-off", ou acordo entre os objetivos, onde se um objetivo aumenta, outro diminui. Desse modo, um MOP não possui uma solução simples, mas contém um conjunto de soluções ótimas, conhecido como conjunto de soluções Pareto-ótimo, que indicam os melhores compromissos entre os diferentes objetivos considerados. Assim, no tratamento de problemas multi-objetivo, é importante identificarmos soluções o mais próximas desse conjunto.},
